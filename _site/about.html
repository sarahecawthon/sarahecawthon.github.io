			<p class="about">
 				I recently completed a full-stack web development program with Omaha Code School and am eager to continue my professional career as a front-end web developer. While in Omaha, I completed several projects for local organizations as well as for personal use that helped to expand my knowledge in a variety of coding languages such as HTML, CSS/Sass, Javascript, Ruby and others. I also developed my skills in design using responsive design principles. 
				<br>
				<br>
				I previously worked as the Director of Testing and assistant to the ADA Coordinator at a private university where I also helped to develop an ESL and Intensive English Program as well as a journalism program equipped with a communication lab and school newspaper.
				<br>
				<br>
				I have also acquired leadership skills and a sense of adventure as an English language teacher in Querétaro, Mexico. While there, I taught elementary, university and adult students from beginner to advanced level English courses. In doing so, I was able to better a variety of students’ English-language skills that helped them to pass college courses, earn promotions at major corporations such as Kellogg in Mexico and even land job opportunities in various positions in the United States and Canada. 
				<br>
				<br>
				In 2015, I received a bachelor of arts in communications with an emphasis in journalism from Indiana University. During university, I worked as the social media editor and staff reporter and photographer for the university newspaper. I also worked as an on-air DJ for IU's student radio station, WIUX, which helped to hone my communication skills on various platforms.
