			<h3 class="article_header_date">March 2016</h3>
		</header>


		<p class="article_content"> “Wealth, rank, or an imposing name counted for nothing. The only credential the city asked was the boldness to dream,” wrote James Truslow Adams, who has been credited with molding the image of the American Dream in New York City, 1931. The poetic words drip with optimism and instill a sense of national pride that makes it nearly impossible to protest.
		<br>
		<br>
		The boldness to dream is precisely what makes the United States and our way of life attractive and magnetic to people in other lands — this is why people are willing to risk everything to pack up their entire life in the pursuit of happiness and to strive for a better life through hard work and fair ambitions, or at least that’s what we’ve been told.
		<br>
		<br>
		Fast forward to 2016 and the dream has been torn to shreds with the realization that that is exactly what it is — a dream. The term was coined by the child of immigrant parents for immigrants, in a country where controlling immigration and military efforts has become a top concern over education and a healthy economy. Because of this, Americans and those from other countries who once thought the U.S. held the key to unlocking their dreams have begun to search for fulfillment outside of its borders.
		<br>
		<br>
		The idea of the American Dream usually refers to receiving a quality education, obtaining a well paying job, owning a nice home and car, providing a stable life for 2.3 children, and some mention of a white picket fence. However, not only is this dream out of reach for an increasing number of American citizens and the majority of immigrants in search of better opportunities, but it is also an outdated ideation for the majority of Americans whose modern dreams focus more on finding meaning rather than means.
		<br>
		<br>
		In the 1950s, when the American Dream took flight, it would have been appropriate for people to bet on opportunity in the U.S. rather than Europe. However, today, that is not the case. According to a Pew Research study, economic and educational mobility are now actually greater in Europe than in America. While the U.S. was once the leader in mass education, it now fails to even make it into the list of top ten.
		<br>
		<br>
		It is no surprise that the American educational system is beginning to lose its credentials when it is set up so that the country’s local property taxes dictate the quality of education students are handed. So, elite schools are provided to wealthy students while poorer students, who are in need of more assistance, inhabit inferior schools.
		<br>
		<br>
		The dream has transformed from a goal that was once obtainable for the poor into a benefit that is only available to the wealthy. But not all privileged Americans are interested in the quintessential ideals of 1950s America. Fewer people are getting married and more couples are opting out of parenthood all together; more children have less education than their parents and more people are leaving the U.S. for residency in other countries than ever before.
		<br>
		<br>
		In 2013, an all time record of 3,000 people renounced their U.S. citizenship. While this number may still seem small, the amount of people leaving the U.S. has continued to escalate throughout the last ten years with no signs of slowing down. Individuals are beginning to realize that there are more viable options elsewhere.
		<br>
		<br>
		And Americans are not the only ones who have noticed.
		<br>
		<br>
		According to a Pew Research study, the number of Mexican immigrants seeking a better life in the U.S. peaked in 2007 at 6.9 million people, but has steadily decreased to only 5.5 million people in 2014. Today, interest in heading to the U.S. has fallen to its lowest point since the 1950s.
		<br>
		<br>
		Immigration from Mexico has made up over half of the total immigrants in the U.S. over the last couple decades. However, things are beginning to change. Throughout the last few years, thousands of Mexicans from all economic and educational backgrounds have returned to Mexico. While they face several hardships and countless obstacles when returning, there is one thing almost all of them can agree on: it’s worth it.
		<br>
		<br>
		Nearly 90 percent of the 1.4 million Mexicans who returned from 2005 to 2010 did so voluntarily (rather than by deportation) and were happy about their decision to do so. Life in Mexico is on the cusp of revitalization and people are beginning to rediscover the potential of their country.
		<br>
		<br>
		The decision to leave Mexico involves a comparison, a straining cost-benefit examination, and increasing opportunities in the country are starting to put departures in check. Crossing the border has become more expensive and more dangerous; the unsanitary, minimum wage jobs and a degrading stigma that awaits immigrants in the U.S. are no longer appealing.
		<br>
		<br>
		Educational and economic prospects are also expanding in Mexico making the allure of remaining in the country more attractive. Incomes have generally risen and poverty has declined. Professional degree holders have more than doubled in the last decade and, with additional knowledge about their country, more have chosen to stay and work in Mexico.
		<br>
		<br>
		These are undoubtedly tough times for the American Dream. The optimism is gone and there is speculation that the dream may be over and that we are, in fact, witnessing the collapsing moment in history when the promise of America faded away.
