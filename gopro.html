		<p class="article_content"> My favorite thing about high school and college was that each student was allotted a certain number of days they were allowed to miss in each class without failing said class. Unsurprisingly, I was always that student who took full advantage of this and missed every single day I was allotted.
		<br>
		<br>
		I mean, why are we given these days if we aren’t expected to take full advantage of them? Some days, my bed and Netflix were just too alluring to leave and, in Indiana, winter’s a bitch. I always found it incredibly adorable when my professors actually thought I was going to scrape a foot of snow off of my car in sub zero temperatures to attempt to drive down barely visible roads. For coffee? Maybe. For class? Never. Priorities.
		<br>
		<br>
		So, even I was surprised when, after I’d received my shiny, new bachelor’s degree, I worked six uninterrupted months at my first full-time job without missing one single day. When I finally realized what I’d done, I promptly called in sick and booked a flight to Florida.
		<br>
		<br>
		My cousin, Sam, had scored a job in Orlando and what kind of cousin would I be if I didn’t visit her at least once, right? We had talked about it too many times to count after I’d receive her “#saltlife” Snapchats of her at the beach and I just couldn’t pass up the opportunity to see her before holiday season (literally) attacked the world of retail. I had little idea what this vacation would entail, but knowing Sam, I knew it would be anything but boring. And she didn’t disappoint.
		<br>
		<br>
		My store only allowed me a five-day vacation because retail hates its employees, but I was still determined to pack in as much fun and de-stressing as humanly possible. So, I blocked my store manager’s phone number, bought a new bikini and boarded the plane. When I arrived in Orlando, Sam and I stopped by Rocco’s Tacos to discuss our game plan for the long weekend. The possibilities (and tacos) seemed endless.
		<br>
		<br>
		Some notable activities of that trip include: journeying up 203 steps to the top of a lighthouse at Ponce Inlet to see the effect the offshore hurricane was having on the waves, soaking up some sun and shopping the famous Ron Jon Surf Shop at Coco Beach, experiencing Downtown Disney as an actual adult, stopping by Epcot’s Food and Wine Festival to grab a margarita in Mexico and some haggis in Scotland, spotting 8 foot sharks at Daytona Beach, and riding jet skis in Cape Canaveral next to 4 foot sharks.
		<br>
		<br>
		Yep, that’s right. Sharks. So, fun fact: I hate sharks. They terrify me. I absolutely adore the ocean, but only if I can admire it from the confines of dry sand. The thought of actually being in the ocean is honestly one of my biggest fears. I think seeing the movie Jaws as a small child was more scarring to me than my parents would like to admit and maybe someday I’ll explore this more closely in therapy. For now, don’t even joke about throwing me off a jet ski in shark-infested waters or I might sacrifice you (SAM).
		<br>
		<br>
		But, I’ve gotten ahead of myself. Sam and I were in Cape Canaveral with a few of her friends and decided renting jet skis would be an excellent way to kill part of the afternoon. Cape Canaveral is fun because it doesn’t actually feel like part of the ocean even though it evidently is. We had our GoPros at the ready and jumped into (what appeared to be) safe waters.
		<br>
		<br>
		Because Sam doesn’t like to tell me things, I actually sat in the driver’s seat for a while and almost successfully threw us both off of the jet ski a few times thanks to my horrible driving skills and complete inability to balance a jet ski while switching seats. It wasn’t until we stopped the jet ski to take a cute photo of us having a great time that I realized we were not alone.
		<br>
		<br>
		*Cue Jaws theme song
		<br>
		<br>
		Right after the photo was snapped, we heard a loud splash a mere foot away from the jet ski. When I looked over, I saw a fin descending into the water. “Is that a dolphin?!” I exclaimed in utter joy and delight. “Uhhhh…no?” Sam answered.
		<br>
		<br>
		*Music gets faster
		<br>
		<br>
		I looked at her, my eyes growing wide, “A fish?” I asked as my heart rate steadily increased. 
		<br>
		<br>
		“It was a shark,” Sam said, as if she was telling me about a goldfish. “The guys who rented us the jet skis told us last time that there are a ton of sharks here, but it’s fine.”
		<br>
		<br>
		*We all die
		<br>
		<br>
		FINE?! What this girl’s definition of fine is, I still have no idea. Apparently this is why she’s the surfer and not me. Sam claims the shark was a good 6 feet from the jet ski and wasn’t big enough to cause us any actual injuries. Although her story checks out because no one was hurt (this time) I still have my doubts and suspect we narrowly escaped with our lives that day.
		<br>
		<br>
		Also, in case anyone was wondering, this is why I have trust issues.
