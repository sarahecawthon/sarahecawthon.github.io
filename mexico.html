		<p class="article_content"> Like all great life decisions, it started as a joke. And unlike what I initially told everyone, my trip to Mexico was not born from carpe diem or even an intense urge to learn Spanish, but rather deep despair.
		<br>
		<br>
		It was October and I had finally taken a long awaited vacation from my increasingly unbearable job in retail to visit my cousin, Sam, in Orlando. In addition to being a badass who isn’t afraid of sharks, she was also lucky enough to have found a job, friends, and hobbies she loved. When I saw how happy she was, I knew I wanted that — or at least her ability to wake-up in the morning and not immediately hit the snooze button in an attempt to avoid life.
		<br>
		<br>
		At this point, I had just been told that no matter what I did or how hard I tried to convince the U.K. how charming and employable I was, I simply did not have the credentials required to be let into the country other than for the 90 days my passport would allow. With no way to gain long-term, legal access to Scotland, I decided that the U.K. wasn’t that great anyway and I should probably set my sights elsewhere.
		<br>
		<br>
		So, when my last day in Orlando arrived, my cousin and I were lounging by her pool still talking about careers. After sorting through every open position at her company and seriously considering becoming a bartender and living off the generosity of drunk strangers, I let out a sigh and offered my solution to everything, “F*** it. I’ll just go to Mexico” and we both laughed.
		<br>
		<br>
		The next day, I returned to life in Indiana where people continually assured me that hating your job is something that you’re supposed to do especially if it’s your first job out of college. The American work motto is something like: “Go to your job, make money, and use the 10 vacation days you’re given each year to do something you love and be where you want to be.”
		<br>
		<br>
		I had almost bought into this insane notion, but when I returned to my store, not only did my store manager fail to show up to work, but I also saw grown-ass women running out of the store with two bags of stolen merchandise. Because I work in “customer service” I was not allowed to confront them because, according to company policy, I could be fired for insinuating a customer is stealing even though their sudden interest in cardio set off the alarm. And suddenly, I remembered why I took that vacation in the first place.
		<br>
		<br>
		So, when I stumbled across an article one night that suggested travel by way of language schools, the advice my dad had given to me after I’d graduated popped back into my head, “If you’re going to do something stupid, now is the time to do it”. And, on a whim (and after a few glasses of wine) I signed up to take a month long Spanish course in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico.
		<br>
		<br>
		Side note: my dad has since specified that the “something stupid” to which he was referring was something more along the lines of applying for jobs that seemed out of my reach in a larger city or attending grad school. Semantics.
		<br>
		<br>
		By the end of November, I had quit my retail job, moved home with my parents and turned in countless resumes that emphasized my “expertise in Adobe CS6” for various waitressing jobs in my hometown. But regardless of how painful it was, I knew in just a few short months I’d be living an adventure in Mexico.
		<br>
		<br>
		Sure, my parents brought up some good points to mull over during my trip like, “What are you going to do when you get back?” and “You do realize you need a real job?” as well as “You’re only going to be living here for a short time, right? Right??” But in true Sarah fashion, I decided I would figure it all out over sangria on a rooftop bar somewhere in the middle of Mexico. At the time, I had more important things to focus on like verb conjugations and planning my weekend trips to Guanajuato and Mexico City.
		<br>
		<br>
		Before leaving, similar to the time three years prior, everyone I knew asked me to stay home and urged me to take Spanish lessons in the US because they were convinced that the drug cartels would find me and kill me. But because I’m incapable of listening to others when I know I need to do something, I knew that Mexico had called and the only thing I could do was answer.
		<br>
		<br>
		When I got to the airport in Leon, Guanajuato, the entire experience felt surreal. While I had dreamed of someday returning to my favorite country, I could not believe I had actually made this happen. I was by myself in a foreign country and I had never felt more alive or sure of what I was doing. I grabbed my bags and proceeded to customs where I was greeted in Spanish and, just as my first time in Querétaro, my cheeks flushed red and I laughed as I said, “Hola. Lo siento, pero no hablo mucho español.” And with that, my new adventure began.
